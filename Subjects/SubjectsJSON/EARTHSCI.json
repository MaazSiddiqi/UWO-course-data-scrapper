Registration in the course is conditional and competitive as course costs are largely covered by external funds raised by the department just prior to departure. A committee will adjudicate students on the basis of grades in program courses, a vision statement submitted as part of the application process, and demonstrated interest in field studies. Course may not be used towards minimum graduation requirements. Students who are not successful will have the course dropped from their record; normal drop dates do not apply to this course. Students are expected to contribute toward the cost of accommodation, food, and miscellaneous expenses."
